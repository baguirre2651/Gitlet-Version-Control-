# Project Overview
A version-control system is essentially a backup system for related collections of files. The main functionality that Gitlet supports is:

  
    -Init: Creates a new Gitlet version-control system in the current directory. 
  
    -Add: Adds a copy of the file as it currently exists to the staging area
  
    -Commit: Saving the contents of entire directories of files.
  
    -Rm (Remove): Unstage the file if it is currently staged for addition.
  
    -Log: Viewing the history of your backups
  
    -Global-log: Like log, except displays information about all commits ever made.
  
    -Find: Prints out the ids of all commits that have the given commit message, one per line.
  
    -Status: Displays what branches currently exist, and marks the current branch with a "*". Also displays what files have been staged for addition or removal. 
  
    -Checkout: Restoring a version of one or more files or entire commits
  
    -Branch:  Maintaining related sequences of commits
  
    -Rm-Branch: Deletes the branch with the given name. 
  
    -Reset: Checks out all the files tracked by the given commit. Removes tracked files that are not present in that commit. Also moves the current branchâ€™s head to that commit node.
  
    -Merge: Merging changes made in one branch into another.
